This is a full-stack application using React & Go. I created this project to gain more full-stack experience and learn Go.

This was inspired by a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fqD6IprIA&t=2214s

// TODO: Update as app progresses
This will not be a simple copy and paste of the tutorial. I will be tweaking the APIs created in the tutorial. I will create new APIs not described in the tutorial. The front-end will be entirely my own mind.
